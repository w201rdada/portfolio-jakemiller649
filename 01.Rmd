Slug: Helping Those who Help the Hungry

## Two Simultaneous Problems

Nearly half of all fruits and vegetables in the United States are discarded, according to a 2016 study. [footnote: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/13/us-food-waste-ugly-fruit-vegetables-perfect?CMP=share_btn_tw] The causes for this – from ugly food being discarded during production, to produce wilting or rotting before it can be eaten at the home – are as numerous as the consequences. Local landfills expand, while hungry populations miss on potentially available fruits and vegetables.

Many food banks, which provide meals and groceries to low-income and needy populations, have taken advantage of food waste from restaurants and grocers to fill their own stocks. For example, the Capital Area Food Bank, which serves the Washington, DC, area, distributes 42 million pounds of food annually – 33 million of which is donated food that would have been wasted [link]. But that supply chain is irregular and difficult to predict, and can be helped by data science.

## A More Predictive Supply Chain

Large food banks have already sought to harness data to determine which neighborhoods are hit hardest by hunger. [footnote: http://cafb.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=01082b9fbae244358c585487c7d29386] Finding the hungry is one challenge, but gathering supplies and feeding them are separate challenges. One subsidiary challenge is managing the intake of food, including that which would otherwise be edible food waste – an irregular, unpredictable supply. 

The Food Waste Forecaster seeks to help this specific issue, helping charitable organizations anticipate the volume and characteristics of donated “waste” food.

We will use data collected about the volumes and types of food donated from each source. If this data does not yet exist, a period of one year will be required for data collection. This measurement and verification will be done by the charitable organization, not by the donating restaurant or grocer. 

Each day’s donation will be categorized by donor and donor type (restaurant, grocer, etc.), with subcategories such as cuisine, location, whether a restaurant is upscale, and whether it provides delivery/takeout. Data will also be collected on the weather, as studies have shown that weather affects food choices.[ https://blog.a4everyone.com/2017/04/20/how-data-analytics-might-reduce-food-waste/] 

The resulting data will be fed into an algorithm and will provide charitable organizations a visualization of predicted food donations. The organization will be able to more accurately predict, for example, that a certain delivery place has less leftover produce on a rainy Wednesday. If a new restaurant signs up to be a donor, the system will forecast that restaurant’s donations based on restaurants with similar characteristics. 

## Risks and Benefits

Charitable organizations will know when to go through other acquisition sources. They might better know when certain legs of their distribution networks will have surpluses of food, while others might be a little short. The goal is a steady food supply that matches the needs of the hungry population.
