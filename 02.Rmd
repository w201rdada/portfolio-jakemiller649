## An Unlikely Hero?

Drive, bike, walk, take the metro or bus, or rideshare?

The choice of modern city-dwellers weighs cost, time, and convenience in each person’s mental calculus. On the question of transportation, societies and governments, however, have a tougher challenge: reducing greenhouse gas emissions. For government officials, encouraging individuals toward mass transit is one solution.

But the prevalence of rideshare services, also known as transportation network companies (TNCs), such as Uber and Lyft are hurting mass transit and exacerbating emissions problems. TNCs have contributed to declining public transit usage and increased total vehicle miles traveled. Individuals use TNCs for trips they otherwise would not have driven, adding cars to the road, and create “deadhead” miles during which drivers circle without passengers. (Clewlow)

The rise of autonomous vehicles (AV) is likely to accelerate this trend. In one preliminary study, using a chauffeur to simulate an AV for test subjects, subjects’ vehicle miles traveled (VMT) increased 76 percent (22 of which were “ghost” trips without subjects in the car). Almost no subjects used bicycles or public transit. (Walker)

Convenience’s price will be clogged roads and clogged air.

State and local transportation and transit entities must re-engage consumers, but there is no shortage of barriers. Medium-sized cities are not highly or densely populated enough for cost-effective mass transit. Even in larger cities, transit networks are poorly laid out, inefficient, and leave large swathes unserved. Traditional subways and light rail are expensive to build and maintain and are not flexible to changing city dynamics. And areas that do receive reliable, consistent service often become unaffordable for a majority of residents.

One possible solution comes from an unlikely source: microtransit. 

Startups such as Bridj and Chariot have attempted on-demand vans and small buses to fill in public transit gaps. So far, however, such companies have tended to serve more well-off communities (Stromberg), while a trial partnership between the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority and Bridj, which is now out of business, gained far fewer riders than anticipated. (Bliss)

Public agencies, however, have different priorities than start-ups. While some public agencies have experimented with microtransit, they have been limited and only chosen through trial and error. (Westervelt) Questions remain on how to design routes, how to structure pick-up and drop-off, and how to reach individuals without smartphones. 

## Find the Data, Run the Tests

Our goal is to help state transportation agencies and public transit entities identify underserved communities and potential routes for targeted microtransit services.  This can include urban and suburban communities in existing transit systems' blind spots as well as medium-sized towns without existing public transit systems.

### The Data

Jake, add figure 1 here

We will seek out census tracts that fit two profiles. First, transit need: This will be determined by income level, typical commute distance, commute time, and car ownership. Second, transit availability and access: We will not only look at nearest rail and bus stops, but also how frequently those stops are served and their hours of operation. We will consider both residential and commercial areas.

We will draw on the following data sources:
* Census data on where people live and work
* Existing public transit data, including origins, destinations, and times
* Existing highway technology that is currently used for travel time estimation and dynamic tolling
* Anonymized tax returns, which provides both primary residence and occupation. If this is unavailable, we will look into including surveys with yearly tax forms
* Car registration data, including not only where cars are owned but how old those cars are 

We do not expect to receive data from private companies such as Uber, Lyft, or Google.

After data processing, calculations, and evaluating census tracts for transit need and transit availability, we will provide public officials and lawmakers with interactive maps to show need and access, and visualizations that show the flow of transportation for a given area throughout a typical day. We will include late night and early morning hours to account for those, such as some retail and restaurant workers, whose work schedules fall outside typical rail or bus operation.

### Plotting Pilots

The data will help transportation officials to decide where to pilot microtransit programs or potentially other traditional transportation services. Ideally, the transit entity will compare similar areas, running a pilot program in one while using others as control..

A crucial step in this phase is designating criteria for success. Overall ridership -- and financial feasibility -- are priorities for private transportation enterprises, but public entities may have others. These could include:

* Right-sizing: An empty bus is bad for emissions, and our data may show where existing bus lines may be pilot subjects for microtransit -- or the converse, where additional bus capacity could be added. Similarly, some routes may be best served with full-size buses during rush hour and smaller vehicles during off-peak hours.

* Wait times: If feasible, we would advocate installing card readers at transit stops that allow a rider to check in before the bus arrives. This would provide the agency a window into how long individuals wait before their transportation arrives.

* Total time in transit: The data may reveal high frequency origin-destination pairs, allowing the agency to pilot express routes. Other data may reveal certain roads ripe for bus-only lanes.

The UpRouted study (Westervelt) demonstrated trials with mixed results. Our trials must be iterative, and will include ongoing data collection. 

## Reducing Emissions on the Eve of the AV Revolution

The long-term goal is to reduce carbon emissions by promoting public transportation. Neither of these two concepts are slam dunks with lawmakers. Public transportation initiatives can be unpopular with rural legislators and small government conservatives, while even gaining acknowledgment of the need to reduce carbon emissions is no guarantee. The presentation of data will need to be clear and actionable. Furthermore, there may be jurisdictional issues to navigate if transit agencies encompass multiple states, counties, or municipalities.

It's also conceivable that TNCs or even car and gas companies might lobby against increases in public transportation.

The potential payoff -- however far down the road -- is huge. Cities' populations -- and road congestion -- are increasing, and building new rail lines is not always feasible.

bring it back to AV

Public transportation has declined in recent  years. With careful study and careful implementation, we can not only reverse that trend but be prepared when the next disruption comes to transportation.
