## An Unlikely Hero?

How can public transit agencies increase ridership, reach underserved populations, and provide reliable service? How can governments promote transportation access without driving up emissions?

Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is one of the greatest challenges societies and governments face, and mass public transportation is one of many ways to address it. But cutting GHGs are not public transit's only benefit: it's safer than driving (citation needed), and reducing cars, in turn, makes roads and highways safer. And most of all, public transit enables low-income and disabled populations to access jobs and services.

There are many barriers. Medium-sized cities are not highly or densely populated enough for cost-effective mass transit. Even in larger cities, transit networks are poorly laid out, inefficient, and leave large swathes unserved. The few areas that do receive reliable, consistent service often become unaffordable for a majority of residents.

At the same time, the prevalence of transportation network companies (TNCs) such as Uber and Lyft are exacerbating emissions problems. TNCs have contributed to declining public transit usage and increased total vehicle miles traveled. Individuals use TNCs for trips they otherwise would not have driven, adding cars to the road, contributing to congestion. (Citation, the UC Davis people)

One possible solution comes from an unlikely source: microtransit. Currently, startups such as Bridj and Chariot use on-demand vans and small buses to fill in public transit gaps. So far, however, such companies have tended to serve more well-off communities, are only available via smartphone apps, and have not been profitable. (Citation, Vox article)

Public agencies, however, have different priorities than start-ups. While some public agencies have experimented with microtransit, they have been limited and only chosen through trial and error. (UpRouted study) Questions remain on how to design routes, how to structure pick-up and drop-off, and how to reach individuals without smartphones. 

## Find the Data, Run the Tests

Our goal is to help state transportation agencies, state and local lawmakers, and public transit entities identify underserved communities and potential routes for targeted microtransit services.  This can include urban and suburban communities in existing transit systems' blind spots as well as medium-sized towns without existing public transit systems.

We will seek out census tracts that fit two profiles. First, transit need: This will be determined by income level, typical commute distance, commute time, and car ownership. Second, transit availability and access: We will not only look at nearest rail and bus stops, but also how frequently those stops are served and their hours of operation. We will consider both residential and commercial areas.

We will draw on the following data sources:
* Census data on where people live and work
* Existing public transit data, including origins, destinations, and times
* Existing highway technology that is currently used for travel time estimation and dynamic tolling
* Anonymized tax returns, which provides both primary residence and occupation. If this is unavailable, we will look into including surveys with yearly tax forms
* Car registration data, including not only where cars are owned but how old those cars are 

We do not expect to receive data from private companies such as Uber, Lyft, or Google.

After data processing, calculations, and evaluating census tracts for transit need and transit availability, we will provide public officials and lawmakers with interactive maps to show need and access, and visualizations that show the flow of transportation for a given area throughout a typical day. 

The data will enable lawmakers and transportation officials to decide where to pilot microtransit programs (or other traditional transportation services). This will help them target unmet needs. They will also be able to compare similar areas, running a pilot program in one while using others as control. Ongoing data collection will show what types of services best provide needs to their constituents or are the most cost-effective.

## Reducing Emissions on the Eve of the AV Revolution

The long-term goal is to reduce carbon emissions by promoting public transportation. Neither of these two concepts are slam dunks with lawmakers. Public transportation initiatives can be unpopular with rural legislators and small government conservatives, while even gaining acknowledgment of the need to reduce carbon emissions is no guarantee. The presentation of data will need to be clear and actionable. Furthermore, there may be jurisdictional issues to navigate if transit agencies encompass multiple states, counties, or municipalities.

It's also conceivable that TNCs or even car and gas companies might lobby against increases in public transportation.

The potential payoff -- however far down the road -- is huge. Cities' populations -- and road congestion -- are increasing, and building new rail lines is not always feasible.

But there's a bigger issue looming over the horizon: autonomous vehicles. If transit agencies can establish routes and ridership in the near future, then they will have an easier time transitioning those routes to AVs or holding off competition from private AV services. Otherwise, individuals may flock to AVs at even greater numbers, exacerbating the emissions problem: one study that attempted to replicate access to AVs showed a family of four increasing its car trips by XXXXX.

Public transportation has declined in recent  years. With careful study and careful implementation, we can not only reverse that trend but be prepared when the next disruption comes to transportation.
