Hi, I’m Jake and this is my project page for W201 Research Design and Applications for Data Analysis (RDADA). This site will contain my two “cool ideas.” Figure .: Hello Benjamin Franklin! Abstract of my first cool idea Within the last few years, researchers, environmentalists, farmers, and grocers have all grappled with the idea of reducing or reusing edible food waste. One primary outlet for edible waste is food banks, who then distribute the food to needy populations, many of whom do not have regular access to fruits and vegetables. The Food Forecaster helps food banks use data to predict near-term donations from regular donors. This tool could help food banks plan for upcoming shortages, know when to leverage alternate acquisition sources, and redirect surpluses to other banks to prevent waste of their own. Abstract of my second cool idea Coming soon. About the author This portfolio is part of my first steps toward a career in data science. I was drawn toward data science because of the potential to solve deep, meaningful, and complex issues, and I believe data science can be used toward making the world a better place. I currently work as a proposal manager for a mid-size IT services company that serves government health and human services organizations. I previously served as a marketing and proposal consultant, and before that as a newspaper writer. My interests include cooking (always happy to recommend a recipe or, if you’re visiting DC, a restaurant), soccer, and tennis. I am a native of Asheboro, NC, received a bachelor’s degree in history from Princeton, and live in Washington, DC. Updated: 2018-03-10 "],
["food-banks-forecast-intake.html", "1 Food Forecaster 1.1 Solve One Problem, Face Another 1.2 A More Predictive Supply Chain 1.3 Building a holistic view of the food supply", " 1 Food Forecaster Keywords food, food bank, food waste 1.1 Solve One Problem, Face Another Nearly half of all fruits and vegetables in the United States are discarded, according to a 2016 study (Goldenberg 2016). The causes for this – from food that is considered ugly during production, to produce wilting or rotting before it can be eaten at home – are as numerous as the consequences. Local landfills expand, while hungry populations miss on potentially available fruits and vegetables. Many food banks, which provide meals and groceries to low-income and needy populations, have taken advantage of food waste from local farms, grocers, and restaurants to fill their stocks. For example, the Capital Area Food Bank, which serves the Washington, DC, area, distributes 42 million pounds of food annually – 33 million of which is donated food that would have been wasted. (“Food Waste” 2018) But that supply chain is irregular and difficult to predict, and can be helped by data science. 1.2 A More Predictive Supply Chain Large food banks have already sought to harness data to determine which neighborhoods are hit hardest by hunger. Finding the hungry is one challenge, but gathering supplies and feeding them are separate challenges. One subsidiary difficulty is managing the intake of food, including edible food waste – an irregular, unpredictable supply. The Food Forecaster seeks to help this specific issue, enabling charitable organizations to anticipate the volume and characteristics of donated “waste” food. We will use data about the volumes and types of food donated from each source. (If this data does not yet exist, a period of one year will be required for data collection before attempting predictions.) The food bank, not the donor, will gather this data, and the gathering process must not require significant extra effort. One possible solution is a smartphone app in which a worker selects food and donor, then enters the weight. Within the system, donors will have characteristics such as location, specific lines of business, and size, Separately, data will also be collected on date and season, as well as specific weather conditions, which affect both business consumer patterns as well as farm production. The resulting data will be fed into an algorithm and will provide charitable organizations a visualization of predicted food donations. The output will be a dashboard that shows a 14-day forecast for incoming donations (e.g., “You are expected to receive 100-120 lbs. of tomatoes next week.”). The main dashboard will display primary food groups, but the user will be able to choose specific foods to see more detailed predictions. Simplicity and ease of use will guide the visualizations, and the user will be less likely to rely on their decision biases and intuitions (such as availability or recency biases, when the employee might erroneously assume the next week’s donations will be similar to the most recent ones). The organization will be able to more accurately predict, for example, that a certain store has less leftover produce on a rainy Wednesday; or, if a dry May means fewer tomatoes from the local farm in June. If a new donor is enlisted, the system will forecast that grocer’s donations based on grocers with similar characteristics. 1.3 Building a holistic view of the food supply Some food banks have strong relationships with local donors, while others are more reliant on national services such as Feeding America. With this tool, those who rely more heavily on local donations will be better able to predict when to bolster their stocks through secondary acquisition sources, such as Feeding America, in which food banks bid against each other (using fake money) for the most prized donations (Prendergast 2017). Furthermore, forecasting food waste intake could be the first step in a larger effort to predict both supply and demand, enabling a food bank or network of food banks to provide steady service while still being able to react to market shocks. There are risks: if people rely on the algorithm too much, if the algorithm is wrong, or there are black swan events that affect the supply of food, there might be severe disruption to service. To mitigate the first two risks, we will conduct a period of measurement and testing, as well as continuous checking during its operational phase. For the third, we will be transparent in our assumptions to the user so that they are aware of risks to consider in short- and long-term planning. This tool will not be the sole decision-maker for the organization on how it acquires food, but it can help those decisions. Bibliography "],

The choice of modern city-dwellers weighs cost, time, and convenience. Over time, however, choices become habits. For governments, the question of transportation has complicating elements. Governments seek efficient transportation networks to facilitate economic activity but are increasingly inclined to decelerate greenhouse gas emissions. Encouraging individuals toward mass transit is one strategy that potentially serves both ends. But how can it be accomplished? 2.1.1 Rideshares, Public Transit, and AV Uncertainty The prevalence of rideshare services, also known as transportation network companies (TNCs), such as Uber and Lyft has, on average, decreased transit use by 6 percent among Americans in major cities. TNCs have also increased total vehicle miles traveled (VMT), a leading emissions indicator, including miles during which drivers circle without passengers. (Clewlow and Mishra 2017) The rise of autonomous vehicles (AV) is likely to accelerate these trends. In one preliminary study, using a chauffeur to simulate an AV for test subjects, subjects’ VMT increased 76 percent (22 of which were “ghost” trips without subjects in the car). Almost no subjects used public transit. (Walker 2017) 2.1.2 Transit at a Crossroads To mitigate the magnitude of clogged roads, clogged air, and vacant seats, state and local transit entities must re-engage consumers. Dwindling riders means dwindling revenues, which in turn produces delayed repairs, more frequent service disruptions, can be potentially soured customers. Subways, light rail, and streetcars are expensive to build and maintain, have long construction times, and are not flexible to changing city dynamics. Even existing transit networks are poorly laid out, outdated, inefficient, or leave large swathes unserved. If public transit agencies are going to regain any ground on TNCs – or avert an AV avalanche – they must create a transit network that is consistent, reliable, fast, affordable, and, most importantly, a part of individuals’ daily routines. 2.1.3 A New Option Is Arriving Microtransit startups such as Bridj and Chariot have attempted on-demand vans and small buses to fill in public transit gaps. So far, however, such companies have tended to serve more well-off communities (Stromberg 2015), while a trial partnership between the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority and Bridj, which is now out of business, gained far fewer riders than anticipated. (Bliss 2018) The postmortem of the Kansas City experiment noted several factors in underwhelming performance. One factor was substandard marketing, but another was insufficient data on origins and destinations. This hampered planners’ ability to design routes.(Westervelt 2018) That’s where we come in. Our goal is to help transportation agencies and public transit entities identify underserved communities and potential routes for targeted microtransit services trials. We will help them make the short-term decision as to where to try such services so that they can make the long-term decision on their viability as part of a greater transportation network. 2.2 Data-Informed Microtransit Tests Figure 2.1: High-Level Workflow. Data scientists will gather and analyze data, then present potential pilot opportunities to transit officials. We will gather data to analyze areas of high transit need and low transit access, then use that analysis to design pilot programs. Potential test cases include: First mile/last mile: Augmenting service with microtransit around stations to increase a station’s serviceable population. This could even be done in partnership with services like UberPool, Lyft Line, and Via by subsidizing rush hour trips that originate or end at rail stops Transit blind spots: Creating new service through currently unserved/underserved areas Right-sizing current routes: Transitioning low-frequency lines to from buses to smaller vehicles. For example, some routes may be best served with full-size buses during rush hour and smaller vehicles during off-peak hours Express service on existing routes: High frequency origins and destinations 2.2.1 Identifying Target Areas We will seek out census tracts that fit two profiles: high transit need and low transit access. Table 2.1: Transit Need. Concept Indicator Commute distance Home address and work address (via census and tax records) Commute duration Duration for computed routes Commute time of day Difference between rush hour and off-peak volumes; duration of rush hour Commute cost Tolls, gas (using estimated fuel efficiency based on vehicle type from DMV data), annual cost of car ownership; parking availability and costs Table 2.1: Transit Access and Availability. Concept Indicator Access Distance to metro and bus stops Availability Hours of operation; frequency and regularity of service After data processing, calculations, and evaluating census tracts for transit need and transit availability, we will provide public officials with interactive maps to show need and access, and visualizations that show the flow of people for a given area throughout a typical day. We will include late night and early morning hours to account for those (such as some retail and restaurant workers) whose work schedules fall outside typical rail or bus operation. 2.2.2 Plotting Pilots Our analysis will help transportation officials plan pilots. Analysis of origins, destinations, and travel times and patterns will be useful in choosing not only when and where but also the appropriate type. There are four high-level classifications (Westervelt 2018): Fixed route/fixed schedule Flexible route/fixed schedule Fixed route/on demand schedule Flexible route/on demand schedule A crucial step in this phase is designating criteria for success. Overall ridership – and financial feasibility – are priorities for private transportation enterprises, but public entities may have additional metrics. These could include wait times, number of connections, total time in transit, and number of everyday users. Ultimately, the last metric is the one we most want to increase: the number of users for whom transit becomes a routine part of their day. 2.3 Building for the Long Term The long-term goal is to promote public transportation, while touting emissions reductions as a significant benefit. Neither of these two concepts are slam dunks with lawmakers who control funding. Public transportation initiatives can be unpopular with rural legislators and small government conservatives, nor is acknowledgment of the need to reduce carbon emissions any guarantee. Furthermore, there may be jurisdictional issues to navigate if transit agencies encompass multiple states, counties, or municipalities. Additionally, environmental regulators and advocacy groups will want information on such services’ emissions efficiency. This system, however, will show the feasibility – or, potentially, infeasibility – of microtransit as part of a transportation network. If the trials are successful and show greater transit access and emissions reductions, then expanding the trials or making them permanent will be an easier sell to lawmakers and other interested bodies. If the trials have negligible or even detrimental effects, then public transit agencies will be able to avoid further investment. In either case, public transit bodies and their sponsoring governments will have a better understanding if this venture is worth additional funding. The upfront investment in microtransit is still much more attainable than rail, streetcar, or bus rapid transit (BRT). It is flexible and lends itself more easily to trials. That considered, it still must be done correctly: learning the lessons from previous studies, there must be public outreach and the services must match the travel patterns of the consumers. Our data and experiments seek to increase the likelihood of the latter. Reclaiming lost riders will prove difficult. Reclaiming them from AVs, if they become the habit or norm, will be moreso. Societies as a whole can profess a desire to combat rising emissions, but it is the sum of individual decisions that will make the difference. Public transit can push that sum in the right direction, but it will require study, planning, and willingness to experiment. Bibliography "],
